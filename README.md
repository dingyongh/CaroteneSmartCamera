# CaroteneSmartCamera
To address carotene extraction monitoring gaps, a tripod-mounted timed camera captures images every 30 minutes, with data stored on Cloud. HSV features from images train 4th-degree polynomial models to infer extraction time. This time then feeds into models predicting yield and concentration, enabling automated monitoring.
